Changing the prompt name in Linux usually involves modifying the `PS1` environment variable, which defines the appearance of the shell prompt. Here's how you can do it:

### Temporarily Change the Prompt Name

To change the prompt name temporarily (for the current session only), you can simply set the `PS1` variable. Open your terminal and type:

```sh
PS1='YourCustomPromptName: '
```

Replace `YourCustomPromptName` with the desired prompt name.

### Permanently Change the Prompt Name

To make the change permanent, you'll need to add the `PS1` assignment to your shell's configuration file. The file to edit depends on the shell you're using:

#### For Bash

1. Open the `~/.bashrc` file in your favorite text editor. For example:
   ```sh
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. Add the following line to the file:
   ```sh
   PS1='YourCustomPromptName: '
   ```

3. Save the file and exit the editor.

4. Apply the changes by running:
   ```sh
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

#### For Zsh

1. Open the `~/.zshrc` file in your favorite text editor. For example:
   ```sh
   nano ~/.zshrc
   ```

2. Add the following line to the file:
   ```sh
   PS1='YourCustomPromptName: '
   ```

3. Save the file and exit the editor.

4. Apply the changes by running:
   ```sh
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

### Customizing the Prompt

You can customize the prompt with various escape sequences to include additional information, such as the current directory, username, hostname, etc. Here are a few examples:

- `\u` - Username
- `\h` - Hostname
- `\w` - Current working directory
- `\t` - Current time

For example, to set the prompt to show the username and current directory, you could use:

```sh
PS1='\u@\w: '
```

Adding this to your configuration file will make the change permanent.

### Example with Customization

```sh
PS1='\u@\h:\w\$ '
```

This example will set the prompt to display the username, hostname, and current working directory, followed by a dollar sign (`$`).

By modifying the `PS1` variable, you can personalize your shell prompt to suit your preferences.
