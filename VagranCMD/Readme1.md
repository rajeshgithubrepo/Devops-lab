Here's a comprehensive list of commonly used Vagrant commands along with brief descriptions for each:

1. **`vagrant init`**
   - **Description**: Initializes a new Vagrant environment by creating a `Vagrantfile` in the current directory. The `Vagrantfile` is used to configure the virtual machine.

     vagrant init [box_name] [box_url]
     ```

2. **`vagrant up`**
   - **Description**: Starts and provisions the Vagrant environment as described in the `Vagrantfile`. This command creates and configures the virtual machine.
   - **Usage**:
     ```sh
     vagrant up
     ```

3. **`vagrant ssh`**
   - **Description**: SSH into the running Vagrant machine. This allows you to access and interact with the VM via the command line.
   - **Usage**:
     ```sh
     vagrant ssh
     ```

4. **`vagrant halt`**
